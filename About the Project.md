# Univariate Timeseries Analysis and ML Forecasting of Mexican Fishing Production
by Fernando Armando Martinez Urrutia

Using Mexico's National Open Database Website, I used my skills as a data analyst|data scientist to gain relevant insights into the fishing industry of this country.
My goal was to work in each stage of the data analysis process followed by the implementation of 3 LSTM RNN models to mainly predict the profit
of the most productive Fisher Mexican state. 
In general terms the process followed was:
  1. Problem Delimitation and Objective 
  2. Data Preparation
  3. Data Exploration
  4. Data Modeling
  5. Data Evaluation
I hope you find this work not only as showcase of my skills but also as an example of the insights that data analysis can bring
